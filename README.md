# [Project 1: Aviation-Accident-Project-Overview](https://github.com/lamyijiekenny/Aviation-Accident-Project)
* Used python/machine learning to conduct exploratory analysis and machine learning algorithms to an aviation accident dataset.
* Created visual models to gauge where most accidents occur
* Feature plots, Naive Bayes models, and Logistic Regression models 
* Created Model to predict future values

# [Project 2: Product-Data-Analysis-Project](https://github.com/lamyijiekenny/Product-Data-Analysis-Project)
* Used RStudio to conduct data analysis on survey results using data mining techniques and tools.
* Analysis methods include Principle component Analysis, Association Rule Mining and Apriori Algorithm and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.
* Used analysis to propose new design and pricing for product.


# [Project 3: 3D-printing-ML-Project](https://github.com/lamyijiekenny/3D-printing-ML-Project)
* Conducted 3D printing experiments for data collection.
* Used Regressin ML methods to create Regressor Chain Model, LASSO Linear Model, and K-Nearest Neighbour model.
* Perform error analysis for each model.
* Used model to predict process parameters, analysed results to come up with optimised set of process parameters.
